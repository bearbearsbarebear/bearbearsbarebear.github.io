# The Little Prince


## Books list
Every year I make a list of books I plan to read. This year I decided to read a book I've read long ago, The Little Prince.
It's such a simple and short book that I read in a single day, but the message behind makes me believe it's a book every adult should read at least once.

The Little Prince is a beloved story about a young prince who travels from planet to planet and encounters a variety of interesting characters. One of these characters is a fox, who teaches the Little Prince about the concept of taming.

The fox tells the Little Prince that "to tame" means "to create ties." When we tame someone or something, we establish a connection and build a relationship with them. This relationship is not one-sided, however, as both parties must put in effort to make it work.

The fox goes on to explain that taming is not about controlling or dominating another being, but rather about finding ways to understand and care for them. It requires patience, kindness, and a willingness to listen and learn.

This concept of taming is a powerful one, as it can be applied to all kinds of relationships - not just those between humans and animals. We can tame our friends, our loved ones, and even our own emotions.

The process of taming is not always easy, and it requires effort and time to build and maintain these connections. But the rewards are well worth it. When we tame someone, we open ourselves up to a deeper level of understanding and appreciation for them. We learn to see the world through their eyes and gain a greater sense of empathy and compassion.

In a world that is often filled with conflict and division, the act of taming can be a powerful force for bringing people together. It allows us to see beyond our own perspectives and learn from those who are different from us.

So the next time you find yourself in a relationship, whether it be with a person, an animal, or even a plant, remember the lessons of the fox and the Little Prince. Take the time to tame, and see how it can enrich your life and the lives of those around you.

`“You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.”`
